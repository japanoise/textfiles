# textfiles
Various text files and text related stuff I'd like to keep on all my computers.

## ansify
Mirror of a program someone wrote that turns images into ansi shit for the terminal.

## cowsay
Cowfiles, mostly made with ansify.

## fortunes
Fortune files from across the net - mostly 9front's, converted into unix-y fortune form.
