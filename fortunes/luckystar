Konata: This is why women are hopeless
Kagami: Aren't you supposed to be a woman!?

Tsukasa: Why is it called a weiner?
*beat*
Konata: Raise your hand if you thought of something naughty!

Konata: When you learn something from Tsukasa, it feels like you've really 
failed.

Kagami: Ah! *gets static from touching classroom door*
Tsukasa: Ah! *gets static from touching classroom door*
Miyuki: Ah! *gets static from touching classroom door*
(later, the girls reach the door. Konata goes to open it.)
Kagami: No!
Konata: Yes! *opens door*

Konata: How come you wear glasses? I mean, you're really pretty but you can 
only appeal to a tiny section of the fanbase.
%
Konata: I may look like this, but I have about a hundred friends, and my social 
and bargaining skills are pretty high, and I join a party every night. With my 
allies, I work to bring back the glimmer in crystals to prevent the world from 
falling to ruin, and rescue the kidnapped princess...

Kagami: Besides winning staring contests, don't you have any special talents?
Konata: Hmmmmm... Oh! I can name every single Pokemon!
Kagami: T-that's seriously amazing! Even if it has nothing to do with your
future...

Kagami: I heard you were working at a cosplay cafe, but don't those places only
hire you if you have a good figure?
Konata: Well, I used to be upset that I have no breasts but... In a particular
game...
*She poses dramatically*
Konata: "Being a flat-chested is a status symbol! It's a precious rarity!" is
what it said. After hearing that, yep, there are people who do have those needs
as well. So I am special!

Konata: Why couldn't they use One Hundred Poets for like a card battle? You
could summon a monk! Think there was a Semimaru! Semimaru uses a shining 
attack! Ono no Komachi uses a lovely strike! Doesn't that sound fun?
Kagami: Back to your world, eh?

[The girls are at a fairground. There is a stall with guns.]
Konata: Oi, mister. We can have anything over there if we hit it?
Attendant: They're all okay.
Konata: All of them?
Attendant: Yeah, all of them.
[Konata looks around for a second, before aiming the gun at the attendant.]
Attendant: Woah, miss, I'm not a prize!

*Konata, Kagami, and Tsukasa are commuting on a busy bus*
Kagami: We sure get a lot of junk mail these days.
Konata: Ahh, it's better to make your address hard to guess. That's how I did
it.
Kagami: Hard to guess? In what way?
Konata: My address is in romaji. iluvgirlswithglasses.
*The other commuters look over, shocked. Konata continues, unaware of Kagami's
embarassment*
Konata: I wanted to go with maids or something... But maids and shrine maidens
are popular and easily-
Kagami: Hold it right there! We get it already, so don't talk so loudly around
the general public! Your conversation is a bigger problem than the junk mail!
%
Shrine maiden outfits are so invigorating!

Yutaka: Tamura-san! What's 'yaoi'?
*Hiyori looks shocked and aghast. There is a pause.*
Hiyori: W-Which definition are you looking for...?

Here it comes! The normalfags are shunning us!
