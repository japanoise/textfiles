A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
How about a nice game of chess?
%
Who are you? Who slips into my robot body and whispers to my ghost?
%
For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in
part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
%
The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the
question of whether a submarine can swim.
%
If you aren't, at any given time, scandalized by code you wrote five or even
three years ago, you're not learning anywhere near enough.
%
Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant
to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap
bubble?
%
It can be argued that the computer is humanity’s attempt to replicate the human
brain. This is perhaps an unattainable goal. However, unattainable goals often
lead to outstanding accomplishment.
%
Functions that create values are easier to combine in new ways than functions
that directly perform side effects.
%
The ocean is a Turing machine, the sand is its tape; the water reads the marks
in the sand and sometimes erases them and sometimes carves new ones with tiny
currents that are themselves a response to the marks.
%
I do not fear computers. I fear lack of them.
%
The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before.
%
The more you know, the more you realize you know nothing.
%
Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.
%
Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
%
In a room full of top software designers, if two agree on the same thing,
that’s a majority.
%
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines
to execute.
%
Low-level programming is good for the programmer’s soul.
%
Simplicity, carried to the extreme, becomes elegance.
%
Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.
%
Don’t document the problem, fix it.
%
If the code and the comments do not match, possibly both are incorrect.
%
UNIX is simple.  It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity.
%
Computers are useless.  They can only give you answers.

19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM - you have been warned.
%
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
%
The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.
%
Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer.  There are three, of
course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
%
To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
%
“But what is it good for?”
(Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM, commenting on the
microchip, 1968)
%
The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.
%
An algorithm must be seen to be believed.
%
Computation has made the tree flower.
%
We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs
to be done.
%
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
%
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own
skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among
other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.
%
We should forget about small efficiences, say, about 97% of the time. Premature
optimization is the root of all evil.
%
In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.
%
A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.
%
Why has elegance found so little following? Elegance has the disadvantage that
hard work is needed to achieve it and a good education to appreciate it.
%
The proof of a system’s value is its existence.
%
A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming, is not
worth knowing.
%
Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses
remove it.
%
If it’s a good idea, go ahead and do it. It is much easier to apologize than it
is to get permission.
%
They know enough who know how to learn.
%
He who asks is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask remains a fool
forever.
%
Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself.
%
The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.
%
Software is useful. But not on its own. Software is just a means to an end.
